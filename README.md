1. Within Github Desktop select UbisoftGameLab2020 as Current Repository
2. Check if anyone made changes (fetch will give you a view of others commits without changing your local code/pull will change your local code)
3. Create a new Branch with the name of the feature you implemented or use an existing one
4. If the branch is new, publish it on Github 
5. Check changed local files that you want to upload
6. Add a description
7. Commit your changes to the branch
8. Push origin (your branch will be seen on Github repository under branches)
9. Then "Open a pull request" (once accepted, it will merge files to the master branch. If someone want to use this new code, go to Github Desktop/Repository/Pull but carefully it may results in conflicts)
